# Tabular Data Extracted from the Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries Catalogue

This repository mirrors the [Bodleian TEI Manuscript Catalogue](https://github.com/bodleian/medieval-mss) in all aspects except for the `tabular_data` directory, which contains an experimental processor designed to extract specific data from the TEI files, and export them in tabular data to enable cross-comparison and increase accessibility.

You do not need to be able to run the processor in order to access the output data: these can be found in the `tabular_data/output` directory, and are currently being updated regularly as the catalogue develops. 

The processor is accompanied by an app which runs locally in a browser and enables users to merge files output by the processor, to suit diverse requirements for use of the data.
