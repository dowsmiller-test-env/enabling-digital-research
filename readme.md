# Tabular Data Extracted from the Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries Catalogue

This repository mirrors the collections and authority data of the <a href="https://github.com/bodleian/medieval-mss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bodleian TEI Manuscript Catalogue</a> in all aspects except for the <code>tabular_data</code> directory, which contains a processor designed to extract specific data from the TEI files, and export them in tabular data to enable cross-comparison and increase accessibility.

You do not need to be able to run the processor in order to access the output data: these can be found in the <code>tabular_data/output</code> directory, and are currently being updated regularly as the catalogue develops.

The processor is accompanied by an app which runs locally in a browser and enables users to merge files output by the processor, to suit diverse requirements for use of the data.
